							Each Member purchases one week in high season which remains the same each year for the duration of the lease. Each Member is also entitled to four planned vacation weeks throughout the year which are chosen several months in advance. To avoid conflicts, an equitable rotation system is used. The lease is for a period of 75 years and Members can sell or transfer their membership anytime.
